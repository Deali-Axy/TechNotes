## Most beautiful Linux operating systems for 2018:
### 1. [elementary OS](https://elementary.io/)

After Linux Mint and Zorin OS, [elementary OS](https://fossbytes.com/tag/elementary-os/) is probably the most popular Ubuntu-derivative . It promotes itself as a “fast and open” replacement for macOS and Windows. There are tons of Linux distros around that are widely used, but elementary OS focuses mainly on non-technical users who are fed up with Windows, and young developers who are new to the open source world. Its development started as a set of themes and apps designed for Ubuntu, so the visual appeal shouldn’t turn out to be surprising.

This beautiful Linux distro borrows some tricks from macOS for its slick interface that prefers to deliver a clutter-free experience to the users. The OS ships without many default Ubuntu applications, replacing them with many lightweight alternatives. It comes with the homegrown Pantheon desktop environment that looks polished and delivers with a lightweight experience. In case you’re having a tough time adapting to Ubuntu’s recent shift from Unity, you can give elementary OS a try.

#### Why use elementary OS?

*   macOS-like look
*   Lightweight and efficient DE
*   Selected set of applications
